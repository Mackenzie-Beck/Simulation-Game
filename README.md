# Simulation-Game

### About

A complex city-builder that simulates a city based on a pop-tile-good system. This project is mainly meant to flesh out said system so that it can be reused and implemented in other, similar games. Look at the wiki section for design documentation.


### Features 

Currently the amount of properly implmented features is a big fat zero. However planned features include:

- economic simulation through production and consumption of goods by pops
- social simulation of pop relations and organization
