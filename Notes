To-Do:


Add pop logic for consuming and producing food. 

Ideas:

Maybe add a pop inventory. So a pop can have certain goods equiped on them, this would be used for things like tools or clothes. 
This can also be used to allow for transport of goods. A pop can physically carry a certain amount of material on their person allowing for trade and such. 

Can use interfaces to differentiate different types of goods. Perishable, edible, wearable, etc.
